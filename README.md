3D embryo membrane segmentation with PH

This notebook shows a method to segment embryo membrane images using persistent homology (PH).

The 2D PH-based mask construction part is related to the following code, but this one is simpler.

After the 2D mask construction, we use 3D PH to detect the centers of the cells.

Using these centers as markers, we can apply the watershed method for 3D segmentation.
